The **Online Medical Management System** is designed for digital health clinics and hospitals to streamline
common medical services. The application allows patients to book appointments with doctors, receive e-prescriptions,
and view their medical records and lab reports. Doctors can offer healthcare suggestions and consult patient records.
The system also allows users to connect with blood and eye donors.
